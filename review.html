        <p>This place is run by educated, innovative & creative people! The architectural
             layout, seating, ambience, lighting, cutlery:servings, design; has been impeccably well thought out! 
            Even the washroom were excellent! The food was AWESOME! This is surprising considering the fact 
            we were there on a Saturday night & they almost had no space! We were extremely well serviced too!
             Rare to find such finesse in Kenya! You must go visit them!<br><br>Irfan Virji <br> KITISIRU
